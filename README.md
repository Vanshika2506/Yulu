# Yulu

Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.

Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

In this project I have used different Hypothesis tests like ttest, ANNOVA, Chi-square test to analyze relationship among various variables. Also, analyzed which variables mainly affect the demand of the bikes.

# Some Recommendations based on insights were:

Focus marketing efforts during peak demand months (June, May, July) to capitalize on high demand periods. By strategically allocating marketing budgets to peak months, YULU can maximize user acquisition and brand visibility when demand is naturally higher.

Offer promotions or incentives during clear sky weather conditions (Weather Type 1) to encourage more ridership. Promotions with favorable weather conditions can boost ridership and enhance the overall user experience.

Introduce seasonal promotions or discounts to boost demand during seasons with lower utilization. Providing incentives during off-peak seasons can help smooth demand fluctuations and encourage usage during periods of lower natural demand.

Since there is a difference in demand between working and non-working days, consider special promotions or expanded services on weekends to attract more users.

Analyze yearly trends and plan for increased demand in subsequent years. Consider expanding operations or introducing new features to accommodate growing user numbers.

Advance planning based on yearly trends ensures YULU is well-prepared for future growth, allowing for strategic decisions on fleet expansion, infrastructure development and service enhancements.
